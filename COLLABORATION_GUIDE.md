## üîÑ Daily Workflow

### Before Starting Work

1. **Always Start with Latest Changes**
   ```bash
   # Switch to main branch
   git checkout main
   
   # Pull latest changes
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   # Create and switch to a new branch
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   
   # Example names:
   # git checkout -b feature/add-customer-queries
   # git checkout -b fix/order-procedure-bug
   # git checkout -b docs/update-er-diagram
   ```

### While Working

1. **Make Changes**
   - Work on your assigned task
   - Follow the coding standards in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - Test your changes thoroughly

2. **Commit Regularly**
   ```bash
   # Check what files you've changed
   git status
   
   # Add files to staging
   git add path/to/file.sql
   # Or add all changes:
   git add .
   
   # Commit with a descriptive message
   git commit -m "feat(queries): add customer order history query"
   ```

3. **Keep Your Branch Updated**
   ```bash
   # Fetch latest changes from main
   git fetch origin main
   
   # Merge main into your branch
   git merge origin/main
   
   # Resolve any conflicts if they occur
   ```

### After Completing Work

1. **Push Your Branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to: `https://github.com/xer0Xavishek/370DBMS/pulls`
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your branch
   - Fill in the PR template with:
     - Clear description of changes
     - Why the changes were made
     - How to test the changes
   - Request review from your collaborator

3. **Address Review Comments**
   - Read all review comments carefully
   - Make requested changes
   - Push updates to the same branch:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "fix: address review comments"
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

4. **Merge After Approval**
   - Once approved, merge the pull request
   - Delete the feature branch (optional but recommended)

## üë• Collaboration Best Practices

### Communication

1. **Use GitHub Issues**
   - Create issues for bugs, features, or questions
   - Assign issues to team members
   - Use labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question`
   - Reference issues in commits: `fixes #123` or `closes #456`

2. **Use Pull Request Discussions**
   - Ask questions in PR comments
   - Provide constructive feedback
   - Use GitHub's suggestion feature for code changes

3. **Regular Sync-ups**
   - Discuss progress regularly (daily or weekly)
   - Share what you're working on
   - Identify blockers early
   - Coordinate on overlapping work

### Division of Work

1. **Assign Clear Responsibilities**
   ```
   Example division:
   - Person A: Database schema design and creation scripts
   - Person B: Queries and stored procedures
   - Person A: ER diagrams and documentation
   - Person B: Testing and sample data
   ```

2. **Use GitHub Projects** (Optional)
   - Create a project board
   - Add cards for tasks
   - Move cards through: To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done

3. **Avoid Working on Same Files**
   - Coordinate to minimize merge conflicts
   - If you must edit the same file:
     - Work on different sections
     - Communicate frequently
     - Pull and merge often

### Code Quality

1. **Review Each Other's Code**
   - Review all pull requests before merging
   - Check for:
     - Code quality and style
     - Proper comments
     - No sensitive data
     - Tests included

2. **Test Before Committing**
   - Run all SQL scripts to ensure no syntax errors
   - Test queries with sample data
   - Verify stored procedures work correctly
   - Check that nothing breaks existing functionality

3. **Document Your Work**
   - Add comments to complex SQL
   - Update README files when adding features
   - Keep diagrams synchronized with code
   - Document assumptions and decisions

## üö® Handling Common Scenarios

### Merge Conflicts

When Git can't automatically merge changes:

1. **Don't Panic**
   - Conflicts are normal in collaboration

2. **Resolve Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Git will mark conflicts in files like this:
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your changes
   =======
   Their changes
   >>>>>>> branch-name
   
   # Edit the file to keep the correct version
   # Remove the conflict markers
   ```

3. **Complete the Merge**
   ```bash
   git add resolved-file.sql
   git commit -m "merge: resolve conflicts in resolved-file.sql"
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Ask for Help**
   - If unsure, ask your collaborator
   - Better to discuss than make wrong choice

### Accidentally Committing Wrong Files

1. **Before Pushing**
   ```bash
   # Undo last commit but keep changes
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   
   # Or undo last commit and discard changes
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```

2. **After Pushing**
   ```bash
   # Revert the commit (creates new commit)
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

### Working on Same File Simultaneously

1. **Prevention (Best)**
   - Communicate before starting work
   - Divide the file into sections
   - Work on different branches

2. **If It Happens**
   - Pull and merge frequently (every few hours)
   - Keep changes small and focused
   - Merge one person's work first, then the other

### Lost or Confused About Changes

1. **View History**
   ```bash
   # See commit history
   git log --oneline
   
   # See what changed in a commit
   git show commit-hash
   
   # See changes in a file
   git log -p path/to/file.sql
   ```

2. **Compare Branches**
   ```bash
   # See differences between branches
   git diff main..your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Restore a File**
   ```bash
   # Restore file from main branch
   git checkout main -- path/to/file.sql
   ```
