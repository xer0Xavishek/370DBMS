## üìù Coding Standards

### SQL Style Guide

#### General Rules

- Use **UPPERCASE** for SQL keywords (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, etc.)
- Use **lowercase** or **snake_case** for table and column names
- Indent nested queries and clauses for readability
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- One clause per line for multi-clause statements

#### Good Example

```sql
-- Retrieve customer order summary with total amount
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.email,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    COALESCE(SUM(o.total_amount), 0) AS total_spent
FROM 
    Customers c
    LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE 
    c.status = 'active'
    AND c.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.customer_name, 
    c.email
HAVING 
    total_orders > 0
ORDER BY 
    total_spent DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### Bad Example

```sql
-- Avoid this style
select c.customer_id,c.customer_name,count(o.order_id) as cnt from Customers c left join Orders o on c.customer_id=o.customer_id where c.status='active' group by c.customer_id,c.customer_name order by cnt desc;
```

### Naming Conventions

#### Tables
- Use singular or plural consistently
- PascalCase or snake_case (choose one and be consistent)
- Examples: `Customers`, `Orders`, `order_details`

#### Columns
- Use descriptive names
- snake_case preferred
- Include table name prefix for clarity when needed
- Examples: `customer_id`, `order_date`, `total_amount`

#### Stored Procedures
- Prefix with `sp_` or `proc_`
- Use descriptive action names
- Examples: `sp_CreateOrder`, `sp_UpdateCustomer`, `proc_calculate_discount`

#### Functions
- Prefix with `fn_` or `func_`
- Use descriptive names indicating return value
- Examples: `fn_GetCustomerName`, `fn_CalculateTotal`

#### Triggers
- Prefix with `trg_`
- Include table name and action
- Examples: `trg_Orders_AfterInsert`, `trg_Customers_BeforeUpdate`

### Documentation Standards

#### File Headers

Every SQL file should start with a header:

```sql
-- =============================================
-- Script: create_customers_table.sql
-- Description: Creates the Customers table with constraints
-- Author: [Your Name]
-- Date: [Creation Date]
-- Version: 1.0
-- Dependencies: None
-- =============================================
```

#### Inline Comments

```sql
-- Calculate discount based on customer loyalty level
UPDATE Orders
SET discount_amount = total_amount * 
    CASE 
        WHEN customer_level = 'Gold' THEN 0.20    -- 20% discount
        WHEN customer_level = 'Silver' THEN 0.10  -- 10% discount
        ELSE 0.05                                  -- 5% discount
    END
WHERE order_date = CURDATE();
```

## üìù Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Types

- **feat**: New feature (query, procedure, table)
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- **refactor**: Code restructuring without changing functionality
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

#### Examples

```
feat(queries): add customer order history query

Added a new query to retrieve comprehensive order history for customers
including order details, payment status, and shipping information.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(procedures): correct discount calculation in sp_CreateOrder

The discount calculation was using the wrong percentage for Gold tier
customers. Updated the calculation to use 20% instead of 15%.

Fixes #456
```

```
docs(diagrams): add ER diagram for order management

Added comprehensive ER diagram showing relationships between
Customers, Orders, OrderDetails, and Products tables.
```

### Commit Best Practices

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Commit logical units of work
- Don't commit unrelated changes together
- Test your changes before committing
- Don't commit commented-out code
- Don't commit sensitive information (passwords, keys)
