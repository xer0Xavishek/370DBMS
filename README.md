## Project Overview

This repository contains the lab project work for **CSE370 - Database Systems**. The project demonstrates the practical application of database concepts including database design, SQL queries, stored procedures, and database management principles.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a complete database system
- Create Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams and schemas
- Write efficient SQL queries and stored procedures
- Perform database analysis and optimization
- Document all aspects of the database project

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Database Management System (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.)
- SQL client or IDE (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)
- Basic understanding of SQL and database concepts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xer0Xavishek/370DBMS.git
   cd 370DBMS
   ```

2. Set up your database:
   - Create a new database in your DBMS
   - Run the SQL scripts from the `src/sql/` directory
   - Load sample data from `tests/sample-data/` (optional)

3. Start exploring the queries and procedures in the `src/` directory

## Documentation

Detailed documentation can be found in the [`docs/`](./docs/) directory:
- Project requirements and specifications
- Database design documentation
- Implementation details
- User guides and tutorials

## Usage

### Running SQL Scripts

```sql
-- Example: Run database creation script
SOURCE src/sql/create_database.sql;

-- Example: Run sample queries
SOURCE src/queries/example_queries.sql;
```

### Testing

Test scripts and sample data are available in the `tests/` directory. Use these to validate your database implementation and query results.

## Diagrams

All visual representations including ER diagrams and schema designs are stored in the [`diagrams/`](./diagrams/) directory:
- **ERD**: Entity-Relationship Diagrams showing database structure
- **Schema**: Detailed schema diagrams with relationships and constraints

## Reports

Project reports, analysis, and documentation are available in the [`reports/`](./reports/) directory.
