# Analysis Reports

This directory contains detailed analysis reports for the database project.

## üìä Analysis Types

### Performance Analysis
- Query execution time analysis
- Index effectiveness evaluation
- Resource utilization metrics
- Bottleneck identification
- Scalability assessment

### Database Design Analysis
- Normalization analysis (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- Denormalization decisions and rationale
- Schema design evaluation
- Data integrity analysis
- Constraint effectiveness

### Query Optimization Analysis
- Query execution plans
- Index usage statistics
- Join optimization
- Subquery vs JOIN comparison
- Query rewriting strategies

### Security Analysis
- Access control audit
- SQL injection vulnerability assessment
- Data encryption analysis
- Privilege management review
- Compliance checking

## üìù Report Templates

### Performance Analysis Template

```markdown
# Query Performance Analysis

## Query Details
- Query ID: Q001
- Description: Retrieve customer order history
- Original Execution Time: 2.5s
- Optimized Execution Time: 0.3s
- Improvement: 88%

## Original Query
\`\`\`sql
-- Original query code
\`\`\`

## Issues Identified
1. Missing index on customer_id
2. Full table scan on Orders table
3. Inefficient JOIN order

## Optimization Steps
1. Created index: `CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON Orders(customer_id)`
2. Rewrote query with better JOIN order
3. Added WHERE clause to filter early

## Optimized Query
\`\`\`sql
-- Optimized query code
\`\`\`

## Execution Plan Comparison
[Include EXPLAIN output before and after]

## Results
- Query time reduced from 2.5s to 0.3s
- Index scan instead of full table scan
- Improved overall database performance
```

### Normalization Analysis Template

```markdown
# Database Normalization Analysis

## Table: [Table Name]

### Current State
- Normal Form: 1NF
- Issues: Repeating groups, partial dependencies

### Dependencies
- Functional Dependencies: A ‚Üí B, C ‚Üí D
- Partial Dependencies: Identified
- Transitive Dependencies: Identified

### Normalization Steps

#### 1NF ‚Üí 2NF
- Removed partial dependencies
- Created separate tables

#### 2NF ‚Üí 3NF
- Removed transitive dependencies
- Further decomposition

### Final Schema
[Show normalized tables]

### Trade-offs
- Benefits: Reduced redundancy, improved data integrity
- Drawbacks: More joins required, potential performance impact
```

## üéØ Analysis Guidelines

### Data Collection
- Use profiling tools (EXPLAIN, SHOW PROFILE)
- Collect metrics over time
- Include peak and off-peak periods
- Document test environment

### Analysis Methods
- Statistical analysis of performance data
- Comparison of different approaches
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Risk assessment

### Visualization
- Charts and graphs for trends
- Execution plan diagrams
- Before/after comparisons
- Performance benchmarks

### Documentation
- Clear problem statement
- Detailed methodology
- Reproducible results
- Actionable recommendations

## üîß Tools for Analysis

- **MySQL**: EXPLAIN, SHOW PROFILE, Performance Schema
- **PostgreSQL**: EXPLAIN ANALYZE, pg_stat_statements
- **SQL Server**: Execution Plans, DMVs
- **General**: Database monitoring tools, profilers

## üìà Metrics to Track

- Query execution time
- Number of rows examined
- Index usage statistics
- CPU and memory usage
- Disk I/O operations
- Connection pool statistics
- Cache hit rates
